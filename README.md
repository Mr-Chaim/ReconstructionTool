Proto reconstruction tool.
This needs a lot of work, the cameras only work on certain angles, also
the reconstruction itself is not working as it should.

1)Needs to have the cameras calibrated or havind them figuring out the
optimal position.
2)Need to figure how to create a mesh with point cloud and remesh it
using my equation.
3)Needs coments to make it more readable.
